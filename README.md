Nintendo VS. DualSystem Frontend
=============================

This is a frontend for the Nintendo VS. DualSystem (aka "[Red Tent](http://www.johnsarcade.com/nintendo_vs_dualsystem_tent.php)") arcade machine.

It is designed to support up to four players on two screens running up to two concurrent MAME instances on a single Windows-based PC.

This is a work in progress project; more details will be added as the project progresses.
